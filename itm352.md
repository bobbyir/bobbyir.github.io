summary: "My team developed an e-commerce website designed to sell betta fish."
---




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key aspects of the project was the implementation of a cart system. Here, I used cookies and sessions to facilitate a seamless shopping experience for users, allowing them to add and remove items while retaining their selections across sessions. This dynamic interaction between user and website demanded a deep understanding of backend programming and data management. Simultaneously, I grasped the nuances of HTML and CSS to craft an appealing and user-friendly interface that complemented the serene aesthetics of betta fish.
<div class="text-center p-4">
  <img width="350px" height="300px" src="../img/bettastorepic1.png" class="img-thumbnail" style = "float: right" >
</div> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I learned about user authentication, creating legitimate login and register pages that ensured the security and privacy of users' sensitive information. Additionally, the development of an admin page emerged as a pivotal feature, alowing me to manage stock levels efficiently and gain insights into the quantity sold. This journey also led me to fashion a search bar, further enhancing user experience.

</div> 
Reflecting on this project, I have absorbed a wealth of knowledge on javascript, json, html/css. From honing my skills in front-end design back-end functionalities, I have emerged with a profound appreciation for the intricate interplay between aesthetics and functionality in web development. This has not only equipped me with practical skills but has also instilled in me a deep sense of accomplishment, fostering a passion to continue exploring the dynamic world of technology and innovation.
