Coding standards have a profound impact in software engineering. They are the scaffolding of having maintainable, and reliable code. By having coding standards, you  provide consistency, reduce any confusion and enhance readability. Also, having good coding standards lead to fewer bugs and more efficient collaboration among developers. Readability is an important aspect when it comes to debugging code and having code that is extremely neat and formatted helps with this. Having good coding standards also helps with following a format when working with a team. When you have good coding standards working on a group project, team members are easily able to read the code. 

In my week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, I've discovered the green checkmark is both painful and useful. While the green checkmark can be challenging, it  results in higher code quality, preventing any subtle errors and making codebases more consistent and maintainable. ESLint goes beyond enforcement; it provides explanations for rule violations, transforming each error into a learning opportunity. This feature, especially useful for newcomers to a language or coding standards. On the other hand, I have found ESLint to be extremely painful, as I can have my code properly run but have many warning signs. There can be a steep learning curve with the warning symbols as some of them can be challenging to debug. Understanding how to fix the warning signs can take some time especially if the rules are not well documented. 

In conclusion, coding standards provide consistency, reduce errors, enhance collaboration, and accelerate language acquisition. My experience with ESLint and IntelliJ reaffirms their significance; the green checkmark, though sometimes painful, is a powerful tool for enforcing standards and fostering continuous learning. Embracing coding standards is not merely a matter of aesthetics; it's a way of producing good software and nurturing a community of proficient developers.
