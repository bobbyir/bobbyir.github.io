  <p>JavaScript has been an engaging language and I have found it to be one of the easier languages compared to Java, C, and C++. The syntax is relatively straightforward and its resemblance to English-like language makes it approachable for beginners. One of the main things I enjoy with JavaScript is the trio of technologies with the combination of HTML and CSS to help build dynamic and visually appealing web pages. For newcomers like me, this makes the learning process very engaging and enjoyable. When comparing it to my languages I learned of C/C++ JavaScript has its advantages in web development and a good choice for front-end and back-end applications. Its ability to run in a browser has been a major advantage and has been a popular language used for many GitHub projects. When it comes to disadvantages, the dynamic nature of JavaScript introduces many unique challenges when it comes to debugging. In JavaScript, functions can be defined and executed in various orders, and they can even be defined after they are called. This asynchronous nature can lead to scenarios where functions are executed out of sequence.</p>

<p>During my practices with the WODâ€™s so far, I have found them to be very helpful. The time pressure associated with WODs has been instrumental in honing my ability to work effectively under stress. I believe this will help me in the real world where there is tight deadlines and being able to remain composed and think critically. The WODs seem to be a good training technique to help me stay focused and produce results even in challenging situations.</p>

<p>One notable aspect of completing a WOD is the sense of accomplishment that accompanies finishing within the set time frame. This achievement not only boosts confidence but also reinforces the notion that problem-solving skills can be refined and developed through practice. The rewards gained from overcoming these timed challenges have motivated me to continuously push my boundaries and seek improvement.</p>
