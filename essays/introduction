The reason why I chose M.I.S. is relatively quite simple; I have a passion for both business and information technology. I was originally a computer science student at the University and while I enjoyed it, I preferred to handle technology with the user and client databases over being a developer. During the end of my semester, I tried exploring other majors and I reached out to friends and guidance counselors for some advice. They recommended me M.I.S. and after further research I found out that it was a perfect fit for me with its emphasis on analysis, design, and management. I realized that I could use information and data to help people and businesses operate and make better informed decisions. Moreover, the growth rate and demand for technology is ever-growing in our modern world and it is a lucrative field with many opportunities. I look forward to taking ITM352 and expect to learn a lot and overcome many challenges.
