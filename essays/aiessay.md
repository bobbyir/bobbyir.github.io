##Introduction 
When we talk about learning software engineering these days, A.I. is a very well known topic.AI tools like ChatGPT, Bard, and Co-Pilot have made learning a lot more interesting and a bit easier. ChatGPT is awesome for quick, straight-to-the-point answers. If you're stuck on a concept or need a quick explanation, it's got your back. Bard is similar – it's great at giving you fast answers and helping you understand stuff without all the fluff. Then there's GitHub Co-Pilot. Think of it as the buddy who helps you with coding. It gives suggestions and solutions while you're writing code, which is super helpful for learning how to program better and faster.
But here's the thing: while these AI tools are amazing at giving us answers and helping with coding, they're not that great when it comes to being creative. They can give you the facts and help solve problems that have a clear answer, but they don't really help you think outside the box or come up with totally new ideas. That's something we still have to do on our own.
So, while AI is super helpful in some ways, like getting to the point and helping with coding, it's not the best at helping us be creative in software engineering. We've got to find a balance – use AI for the quick stuff but also work on our own creativity and problem-solving. That way, we'll be good at both the technical stuff and coming up with cool, new ideas.


During Experience WOD’s I rarely have used chat GPT to help me. This was because the videos that were provided were more than enough to finish me through the assignment. 
I have used chat GPT for the in class practice wods. One example is doing the murphy wod where we had to convert the format code for the website to react.
During the Workouts of the Day (WODs) in my course, I often turned to ChatGPT for assistance. An example of this was during the "Buzz" WOD, where the challenge was to build an entire website in less than 40 minutes. When I encountered small syntax errors, which can be frustrating and time-consuming, ChatGPT quickly pointed me in the right direction, saving precious minutes. Its guidance was not just limited to fixing errors; it also helped me with styling aspects of the website. What made ChatGPT especially helpful was its ability to provide concise and accurate advice. Instead of sitting through lengthy documentation or searching online forums, I could get immediate responses allowing me to be efficient.

In the final project i have asked chat gpt for help on the data modeling of our website.For example knowing how to link collections together and form relationships
When learning a new concept, chat gpt is helpful in truly getting in depth knowledge. I can ask questions and it will respond formally and professionally.

Did not use
I do ask chat gpt to give examples of how certain codes work. For example in my final project I wanted to create a multipage form and I asked chat gpt to give me it.
Most of the time when i read code that i find unfamiliar such as bowl folios I plug in the code in chat gpt. Surprisingly, chat gpt is smart enough to figure out what the code does.
I mainly write my own code and ask chat gpt to fix it for me. However, I dont ask chat gpt to write me code unless its a basic outline structure and i am too lazy to type.
Did not use
Chat gpt is good at debugging code and i found it helpful to give chat gpt a big chunk of code and explain why a certain line in that particular code does not work.

##Impact on Learning and Understanding

AI has really changed the way I learn in my software engineering classes. With tools like ChatGPT, I can quickly get answers to lots of questions without having to search all over the internet. This has made studying a lot easier and more efficient. It's great for understanding tough concepts and improving my coding skills by suggesting different ways to solve problems. But I also try to make sure I don't rely on it too much and lose my ability to figure things out on my own. Overall, AI has been a big help in learning software engineering.

##Practical Applications
In the world of art and creativity, AI has started to play a really interesting role. It's not just about painting and drawing anymore; AI is now helping to create new kinds of art. For example, there are AI programs that can take a bunch of different pictures and mix them together to make a totally new image. This kind of art is really unique because the AI can come up with combinations that most people might not think of. A cool example of this is AI-generated artwork that's even been sold at big art auctions, like Christie's. This shows that AI art is not just a fun experiment; it's becoming a real part of the art world. However, while AI can make some pretty neat stuff, it doesn't really 'understand' art the way humans do. It can't feel emotions or have personal experiences, which are super important in making art that really touches people. So, even though AI is doing some cool things in art, there's still a lot of debate about whether it's as good as what humans can create. But one thing is clear: AI is definitely opening up new doors in how we think about and make art.

##Challenges and Opportunities
Using ChatGPT for coding assistance has been really helpful, but it's not without its challenges. One issue I've faced is when working on larger projects with many folders. ChatGPT sometimes struggles to grasp the entire structure and organization of my project, which can lead to confusion and less effective guidance. It's tricky for the AI to understand the full context when the project gets complex. On the opportunity side, the recent ability to send photos to AI tools is exciting, though it's still in its early stages. This feature has the potential to become a game-changer, especially if it evolves to understand and analyze project structures or debug code from screenshots. Imagine if AI could visually map out our project folders and provide more context-aware assistance—that would take the usefulness of AI in software engineering education to a whole new level. 

##Comparative Analysis
In software engineering education, traditional teaching methods and AI-enhanced approaches have their own strengths. Traditional methods, like lectures and textbooks, are great for giving students a solid foundation of theory. They're reliable and have been used for years, but sometimes they can be a bit boring and it's hard to remember everything. On the other hand, AI-enhanced learning is more interactive and engaging. Tools like ChatGPT can answer your questions instantly, making learning feel more like a conversation. This can make it easier to understand tough concepts and remember them better. Also, AI tools offer practical experience, like coding help, which is super useful for developing real-world skills. So, while traditional methods provide the basics, AI adds an interactive and hands-on touch, making learning more engaging and practical.

##Future Considerations
Looking ahead, AI seems set to play an even bigger role in software engineering education. I think we'll see AI becoming smarter and more helpful, making learning even more interactive and personalized. It could help us understand complex topics quicker and even offer more advanced coding assistance. However, there are challenges too. We'll need to make sure AI tools don't make mistakes in teaching, and that they keep improving to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. Also, it's important that students still learn to think for themselves and not rely too much on AI. In the future, balancing AI assistance with traditional learning methods and ensuring ethical use of AI will be key. Overall, AI has a lot of potential to make learning software engineering more efficient and engaging, but we need to use it wisely.

##Conclusion
VIII. Conclusion
In conclusion, using AI, especially ChatGPT, in my Software Engineering course has really helped me grow as a programmer. It's great for getting fast answers and diving deeper into complex topics. The immediate feedback and solutions have been a game changer in understanding difficult concepts and improving my coding skills. However, it's important to balance this with traditional learning to ensure a well-rounded education.
