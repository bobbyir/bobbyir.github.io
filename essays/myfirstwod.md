During the first WODS including the ones in class, It was more of a refresher such as properly knowing how to structure functions, create loops, and classes. However, these were more of the basics that I needed to cover since I have not programmed in so long. For the next few WODS I could do a better job at constructing my variable names. Most of the time, I tend to get lazy on writing proper variable names and it is bad practice in the future. WODS to me are a great way to learn. I love the idea of having to implement your own solution and it feels like a puzzle game. However, since I am a person that likes to take my time, I don’t enjoy the time pressure associated with the WODS. This is most likely because I like to think of alternative solutions to how I can solve such problems. For example, on Jamba juice 1, it asked to implement a Find Menu Item where you pass in a string and return all the ingredients associated with it. One of the things I learned that was different from how the professor approached it was using the  filter method. I decided that this way was better because it was written in just one line of code. Overall, the WODS I believe that WODS are a good and valuable strategy in honing in on your programming skills however, at the same time if you don’t take in the time to truly understand something or maybe copying without understanding then it serves no purpose at all.
