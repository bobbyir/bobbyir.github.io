Entering the University of Hawaii at Manoa, my initial choice of major was in Management Information Systems within the business side. However, it was during a software engineering course that I underwent a change in interest. The art of coding, problem-solving, and the potential to create applications fascinated me. This was a turning point that sparked a passion within me, prompting me to pivot into Computer Science. I may not have been a technical programming prodigy from the start, the excitement of continuous learning in the field of software engineering convinced me that this was the right direction for my future.

I recognized that my inclination towards problem-solving and analytical thinking was the match within this domain. Through coding, I discovered i can create so many things with the spark of my imagination. Even though my initial programming skills are not the best right now, the prospect of refining them and watching them evolve over time is an exhilarating prospect. The software engineering class that initially sparked my interest was the pivotal point, showcasing the potential to create applications that can enhance user experiences. The knowledge that my work could directly impact people's lives and contribute to societal progress was something that resonated deeply with me

Embracing software engineering as a career isn't just about proficiency in programming; it's about embracing a mindset of continuous growth and adaptation. The recognition that I wasn't already a programming expert didn't discourage me. Instead, it fueled my determination to learn and improve. The ever-growing nature of technology means that a software engineer's journey is one of perpetual learning, and this prospect excites me. With each challenge I tackle and each project I engage with, I am presented with opportunities to refine my skills and broaden my understanding. The journey towards mastery is what convinced me that software engineering is not only an interest but a passion worth pursuing.
