Selecting computer science as my field of interest was not a decision I arrived at lightly. Upon entering the University of Hawaii at Manoa, my initial choice of major was in Management Information Systems within the business realm. However, it was during a software engineering course that I underwent a transformative experience. The intricacies of coding, problem-solving, and the sheer potential to create with lines of code fascinated me. This was a turning point that ignited a passion within me, prompting me to reconsider my academic path. While I may not have been a technical programming prodigy from the start, the promise of growth and the excitement of continuous learning in the dynamic field of software engineering convinced me that this was the right direction for my future.

The allure of software engineering lies not just in its technical challenges, but in its capacity for innovation and creation. I recognized that my inclination towards problem-solving and analytical thinking found an ideal outlet within this domain. Through coding, I discovered new ways to bring ideas to life. Even though my initial programming skills were modest, the prospect of refining them and watching them evolve over time became an exhilarating prospect. The software engineering class that initially sparked my interest was the pivotal point, showcasing the potential to create applications that can enhance user experiences. The knowledge that my work could directly impact people's lives and contribute to societal progress was something that resonated deeply with me

Embracing software engineering as a career isn't just about proficiency in programming; it's about embracing a mindset of continuous growth and adaptation. The recognition that I wasn't already a programming expert didn't discourage me. Instead, it fueled my determination to learn and improve. The ever-evolving nature of technology means that a software engineer's journey is one of perpetual learning, and this prospect excites me. With each challenge I tackle and each project I engage with, I am presented with opportunities to refine my skills and broaden my understanding. This journey towards mastery, coupled with the ability to contribute meaningfully to the digital landscape, is what convinced me that software engineering is not only an interest but a passion worth pursuing.
